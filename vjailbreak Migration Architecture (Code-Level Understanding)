## 4. vjailbreak Migration Architecture (Code-Level Understanding)

### Module 01 — Project Orientation (vjb VM)

vjailbreak is designed as a self-contained migration appliance delivered as a QCOW2 image.

It enables migration of VMs from VMware vCenter to OpenStack (KVM-based environments).

The vjailbreak VM runs a **k3s Kubernetes cluster** which hosts all migration components.

---

### Core Components

#### K3s Kubernetes Cluster

The foundation of vjailbreak is a lightweight K3s Kubernetes distribution running entirely inside the appliance VM.

Key components include:

- **K3s Server** — Kubernetes control plane node  
- **containerd** — Container runtime  
- **etcd** — Kubernetes state database  
- **kubeconfig** — Cluster authentication configuration  

---

#### Application Components

**vjailbreak UI**  
A web interface for managing migrations, deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment.

**Migration Controller**  
The orchestration engine that:

- Manages custom resources  
- Handles worker node provisioning  
- Coordinates migration execution  

**v2v-helper Pods**

Responsible for VM conversion using `virt-v2v`:

- Convert VMDK → QCOW2  
- Inject VirtIO drivers (Windows)  
- Handle disk transfer & transformation  

---

### Custom Resources (CRDs)

vjailbreak defines several Kubernetes CRDs:

- **OpenstackCreds** — OpenStack authentication details  
- **VMwareCreds** — VMware / vCenter credentials  
- **VMwareMachines** — Discovered VM inventory  
- **NetworkMapping** — VMware → OpenStack network mapping  
- **StorageMapping** — Datastore → Cinder mapping  
- **VjailbreakNode** — Migration infra nodes  
- **MigrationTemplate** — Reusable configs  
- **MigrationPlan** — Workflow definitions  
- **Migration** — Execution resource  

---

### Initialization Process

#### First Boot Sequence

On first appliance boot:

1. Cron job triggers `/etc/pf9/install.sh`  
2. K3s single-node cluster initializes  
3. Preloaded container images are imported  
4. Kubernetes manifests are applied  
5. Migration services start  

---

### Critical Directories & Files

#### Configuration Paths

- `/etc/pf9/` — Core configs & scripts  
- `k3s.env` — Cluster config  
- `k3s/token` — Join token  
- `images/` — Container image bundle  
- `htpasswd` — UI authentication  

#### Migration Paths

- `/home/ubuntu/` — Workspace  
- `vmware-vix-disklib-distrib/` — VDDK libraries  
- `virtio-win/` — Windows drivers  
- `/var/log/pf9/` — Migration logs  

---

### Network Configuration

- Primary interface via DHCP or static IP  
- DNS resolution required for VMware connectivity  

#### Required Connectivity

**VMware**

- vCenter — 443  
- ESXi hosts — 902, 22  

**OpenStack APIs**

- Keystone  
- Nova  
- Cinder  
- Neutron  

**Internet**

- Required for driver downloads  

---

## Module 02 — v2v-helper

### Overview

- v2v-helper is the heart of vjailbreak.  
- It performs the actual VM migration from VMware to OpenStack (worker program).  
- It runs as a containerized Kubernetes Job and handles disk copying, format conversion, and target VM creation.

---

## Components Inside v2v-helper Pod

1. **v2v-helper Binary (Main Program)**  
   - Reads migration configs  
   - Coordinates all tools  
   - Reports status back to Kubernetes  

2. **VMware VDDK**  
   - VMware’s official disk access library  
   - Reads VMware disks via snapshots  
   - Supports CBT (Changed Block Tracking)  

3. **NBD Server + Client Utilities**  
   - Exposes VMware disks as block devices  

4. **virt-v2v**  
   - Open-source conversion tool  
   - Converts VMDK → QCOW2 (KVM format)  
   - Removes VMware Tools  
   - Installs VirtIO drivers  
   - Ensures VM boots correctly on OpenStack  

5. **OpenStack Client Libraries**  
   - SDKs / CLIs to interact with OpenStack APIs  

6. **Linux Block & Filesystem Tools**  
   - Disk handling and filesystem operations  

7. **Kubernetes Client / Event Reporter**  
   - Reports migration progress & events  

8. **Configurations & Secrets (Mounted)**  
   - Credentials and mapping configs  

---

## Migration Flow / Execution Steps

### 1. v2v-helper Pod Creation

- User creates a `MigrationPlan`  
- Controller processes the plan  
- For each VM → one v2v-helper pod is created  

---

### 2. Initialization

v2v-helper starts and reads configuration:

- VM name / ID  
- Migration type (Hot / Cold)  
- Network mapping  
- Storage mapping  

---

### 3. Connect to VMware vCenter

Using `VMwareCreds`:

- Connects via vSphere APIs  
- Fetches:
  - VM metadata  
  - Disk list  
  - Disk sizes  
  - Power state  

This helps v2v-helper understand the VM layout.

---

### 4. Connect to OpenStack

Using `OpenstackCreds`:

- Authenticates via Keystone  
- Verifies access to:
  - Cinder  
  - Nova  
  - Neutron  

---

### 5. Create OpenStack Volumes

Steps:

- Reads disk size from VMware  
- Uses `StorageMapping`  
- Creates matching Cinder volumes  
- Marks boot disk as bootable  

**Example**
VMware Disk 1 (50 GB) → OpenStack Volume 1 (50 GB)
VMware Disk 2 (100 GB) → OpenStack Volume 2 (100 GB)


Volumes are empty initially.

---

### 6. Attach Volumes to v2v-helper Pod

After creation:

- Volumes attach to the pod  

Example device mapping:

/dev/vdb
/dev/vdc


---

### 7. Disk Copy Begins (NBD — Critical Step)

NBD streams disk data block-by-block.

Mapping example:

/dev/nbd0 → VMware disk
/dev/vdb → OpenStack volume


Copy logic:
Read block from /dev/nbd0
Write block to /dev/vdb
Repeat until complete


---

### 8. Snapshot Handling

Depends on migration type:

#### Cold Migration

- VM powered off  
- Disk static  
- Single full copy  

#### Hot Migration

- Snapshot created  
- Initial full copy  
- Incremental copies via CBT  
- Final cutover sync  

---

### 9. OS Conversion (virt-v2v)

After disk copy:

virt-v2v performs:

- Removes VMware Tools  
- Installs VirtIO drivers  
- Fixes bootloader  
- Adjusts NIC configuration  

---

### 10. Create VM in OpenStack

v2v-helper calls Nova:

- Uses created volumes  
- Attaches networks via `NetworkMapping`  
- Assigns flavor  
- Creates target VM  

---

### 11. Boot & Verification

- Boots the VM  
- Runs health checks  
- Executes first-boot scripts  
- Confirms VM readiness  

---

### 12. Status Reporting & Exit

- Updates `MigrationPlan.status`  
- Emits Kubernetes events  
- Pod exits after completion  

---

## Pod Lifecycle

Created → Running → Completed → Terminated

## Module 03 — vpwned Agent

### Overview

- The vpwned agent runs as a Kubernetes pod in the `migration-system` namespace.  
- It is deployed alongside the Migration Controller.  
- Acts as an API service that the Migration Controller and UI call to perform VMware vCenter operations.  
- Functions as a centralized control-plane service.

---

## Core Components

### 1. gRPC Service Implementation

The vpwned agent is built using **gRPC**, with **gRPC-Gateway** enabling REST API exposure.

This allows both:

- Internal gRPC communication  
- External REST API calls  

The service definitions handle infrastructure validation and operational requests.

---

### 2. API Endpoints

The service exposes key endpoints via **HTTP POST**:

---

#### 2.1 ValidateOpenstackIp

Validates OpenStack IP availability.

Functions:

- Checks whether provided IPs are already in use  
- Detects duplicate IP entries  
- Returns validation status for each IP  
- Provides failure reasons if conflicts exist  

---

#### 2.2 RevalidateCredentials

Re-validates infrastructure credentials.

Functions:

- Validates VMware credentials  
- Validates OpenStack credentials  
- Updates credential status in Kubernetes  
- Triggers resource discovery after successful validation  

---

#### 2.3 InjectEnvVariables

Injects environment variables into running pods.

Use cases:

- Dynamic configuration updates  
- Runtime parameter injection  
- Migration environment adjustments  

---

## Key Functions

The vpwned agent provides several operational capabilities:

### Version Management

- Handles upgrade orchestration  
- Tracks upgrade progress  
- Performs cleanup after version transitions  

---

### Cleanup Operations

- Executes pre-upgrade cleanup  
- Reclaims post-migration resources  
- Removes temporary migration artifacts  

---

### Validation Services

- Credential validation  
- Infrastructure access verification  
- IP availability checks  

---

### Bare Metal Management

- Lifecycle management of bare-metal hosts  
- Provisioning coordination  
- Resource tracking within migration workflows  

---

## Module 04 — Kubernetes Controllers & Migration Orchestration

---

### Core Idea

The vJailbreak system uses Kubernetes Controllers to orchestrate the entire migration workflow.

These controllers watch **Custom Resources (CRs)** and continuously reconcile their **actual state** toward the **desired state**, managing everything from credential validation to full VM migration execution.

---

## Migration Orchestration Flow

### 1. vJailbreak Appliance VM Deployment

A single vJailbreak appliance VM is deployed.

This VM already contains:

- Kubernetes cluster  
- vJailbreak components (UI, controllers, services)  

Once deployed:

- Kubernetes is up  
- Controller Manager is running  
- UI is accessible  

---

### 2. User Accesses the UI

The user opens the vJailbreak UI via browser to begin migration setup.

---

### 3. User Provides Environment Configuration

Through the UI, the user enters:

- VMware vCenter details  
- OpenStack credentials  
- Network mapping  
- Storage mapping  

---

#### UI Action

The UI communicates with Kubernetes API and creates CRDs:

- `VMwareCreds`  
- `OpenstackCreds`  
- `NetworkMapping`  
- `StorageMapping`  
- `MigrationTemplate`  

---

### 4. Controllers React to CRDs

Controllers continuously watch these resources.

When CRDs are created or updated:

- Credentials are validated  
- Infrastructure inventory is discovered  
- CRD status fields are updated  

---

### 5. User Creates a MigrationPlan

From the UI:

- User selects a VM  
- Clicks **Start Migration**  

This action creates a:

MigrationPlan CRD


---

### 6. Controller Reconciliation Logic

The `MigrationPlan` reconciler detects the new resource.

It enters the Kubernetes controller loop: Reconcile()


Here the controller evaluates:

- Migration readiness  
- Resource mappings  
- Credential validation  

---

### 7. Controller Triggers Migration Execution

If validation succeeds:

- Controller creates a `v2v-helper` Job/Pod  
- Migration execution begins  

Controller updates status: MigrationPlan.status.phase = Running


---

### 8. Controller Tracks Migration Progress

The controller continuously monitors the pod state.

#### Success Path

status.phase = Completed


#### Failure Path

status.phase = Failed


Progress updates are reflected in:

- Kubernetes events  
- MigrationPlan status  
- UI dashboards
